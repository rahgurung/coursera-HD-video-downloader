## Usage

3) Ctrl + S
4) It's all yours

## Installation

[Firefox Addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/coursera-hd-video-downloader/)

## Development

To run a development server that will watch for file changes and rebuild the scripts, run:

```
yarn start
```

To just build the files without the development server:

```
yarn build
```

Both commands will create a `dist/` directory, it will contain the built files that should be loaded into the browser or packed.
